## Predict housing price with Decision Forest<br>
Using Decision Forests to predict housing prices helps in accurately estimating property values, aiding people in making informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Abstract<br>
Using TensorFlow Decision Forests, we predict housing prices by training a Random Forest model on a dataset. This process involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
This notebook demonstrates the use of TensorFlow Decision Forests to predict housing prices, showcasing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
<br>
<br>
Libraries Used<br>
We utilize several libraries including TensorFlow, TensorFlow Decision Forests, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling, model training, and visualization.
<br>
<br>
Role of Decision Forests<br>
TensorFlow Decision Forests plays a crucial role by providing a robust Random Forest model, which is trained on housing data to predict sale prices.
<br>
<br>
Performance Metrics<br>
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. The model achieved an MSE of 1173813248.0000 on the validation set.

<br>
* Step 1: Import the necessary libraries.<br>
* Step 2: Load the training data from the specified file path.<br>
* Step 3: Preprocess the data by dropping rows with missing values and separating the label (SalePrice).<br>
* Step 4: Convert the preprocessed pandas DataFrame into a TensorFlow dataset suitable for training.<br>
* Step 5: Initialize and compile a RandomForest model for regression.<br>
* Step 6: Train the model using the training dataset.<br>
* Step 7: Load the test data from the specified file path and separate the 'Id' column.<br>
* Step 8: Convert the test data into a TensorFlow dataset.<br>
* Step 9: Use the trained model to predict house prices on the test dataset.<br>
* Step 10: Create a submission DataFrame with the 'Id' and predicted 'SalePrice' values and save it to a CSV file.<br>
* Step 11: Display the first few rows of the submission DataFrame.<br>
